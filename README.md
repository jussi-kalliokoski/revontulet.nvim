# revontulet.nvim

A dark but vibrant color scheme for neovim inspired by the northern lights. All the colors are derived from various images of the aurora borealis (revontulet in Finnish) with some hand-picked adjustments or sometimes complete hue shifts to provide a wider swatch of colors. The intent is to provide a visually pleasing and vibrant dark color scheme with a good contrast ratio.
